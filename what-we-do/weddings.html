<p>Weddings within Church of England services are a wonderful
  way to begin a new life together. The bride and groom make their
  vows before God and in the presence of their family and friends.
  At St Mary’s we are delighted to celebrate the marriage of many
  couples. And yes we welcome confetti!</p>
<p>A church service offers both an opportunity to capture a vision
  for the years to come, and fulfils all the legal requirements under
  British Marriage Law. Under current legislation couples may marry
  at the parish church where either of them lives, or where either
  or them are a member of the church’s electoral roll.</p>
<p>In addition couples may marry in a Church of England parish:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where either of them was baptised or confirmed.</li>
  <li>Where their parents/grandparents were married.</li>
  <li> A parish where either of them, or their parents*, has previously
    lived for at least 6 months.</li>
  <li>A church where either of them, or their parents*, has attended
    worship for at least 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">* This must have been within the lifetime of the couple
  themselves.</p>
<p>It might all sound a bit complicated, but it is really quite simple.
  So if you would like to know any more please ring the Parish Office,
  the details are on the <a href="/contact/">Contacts page</a>.</p>
<p>A member of the clergy team will meet with each couple and guide
  you through all the arrangements.</p>
