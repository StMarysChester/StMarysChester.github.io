<h2>Baptisms</h2>

<p>Originally baptism was an act of Christian initiation undertaken
  only by adults. In time Christian parents asked that their children
  also be made members of the Church, hence the service in which
  children are baptised, and at which their parents and godparents
  make the decision on their behalf. In time the young person reaches
  an age when they are able to make this decision for themselves, and
  they come for Confirmation.</p>
<p>Baptism is a serious commitment and a family celebration. It is
  something to think about seriously as bringing small children to
  church on a regular basis is not an easy undertaking. It takes
  time, determination and commitment. Baptisms are arranged by first
  of all ringing our Parish Office, the details are on the
  <a href="/contact/">Contacts page</a>. We have a team of baptism
  visitors who will call on local families to help with the
  arrangements and to welcome you to St Mary’s.</p>
<p>Every autumn the baptism team arrange a special Baptism Tea
  Party to which we invite all those baptised over the past couple
  of years. Parents and children take part in story telling, usually
  either Noah’s Ark, Jonah and the Whale, or Daniel in the Lion’s Den.
  (Sometimes we have a boat in church, but never real live lions!)</p>
