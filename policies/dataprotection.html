<h2>Data Protection</h2>

<p>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) came into effect
  on 25 May 2018, replacing the earlier 2008 Data Protection Act
  and strengthening the earlier requirements to protect personal
  information held by organisations.
</p>
<p>All  registered charities, including parishes, must comply with
  GDPR to ensure that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal data is processed lawfully, transparently and fairly.</li>
  <li>Data is used for the specific purpose/s for which is held,
    and none other without further consent.</li>
  <li>Data will be kept up to date and only for as long as required.</li>
  <li>Data will not be disclosed to third parties without consent of
    the individual.</li>
  <li>St. Mary's has drawn up a Data Privacy Notice which sets out in
    greater detail how we manage and look after personal data held
    by the PCC and the Clergy team.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Notice is available to view on Noticeboards in Church and in
  the Parish Centre.</p>
<p>To exercise all relevant rights, queries or complaints please in
  the first instance contact the PCC Secretary/Data Controller via
  St. Mary's Parish Office, Overleigh Rd, Chester CH4 7HL.</p>
<p>You can also contact the Information Commissioner's Office at
  Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire. SK9 5AF
