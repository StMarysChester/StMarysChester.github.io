      Welcome to St Mary Without-the-Walls Handbridge. We are an Anglican parish church
      in the heart of Handbridge in Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      People come to St Mary's from a range of backgrounds, with different gifts
      and experiences, and we welcome that and rejoice in the diversity of
      people God calls to follow him. So we seek to be an inclusive community.
      As we try to keep that tradition of hospitality alive, we look forward to
      welcoming you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are looking for a Sunday service, worship with children, a
      wedding, baptism, funeral, volunteering opportunity or venue for an
      activity in our St Mary's Centre. We are here for you.
